# Lord of the Rings LCG Assets

A collection of visual assets for the Lord of the Rings LCG.

## Fonts

The Lord of the Rings LCG uses a variety of fonts on the cards, in the rulebooks, etc.

### Vafthrudnir-Ext

The Vafthrudnir font is mainly used for the title / name of cards.
Some of the card names feature diacritics (eg: accents) on certain characters, which were not included in any of the versions of the font I could find.

I imported the font into [GlyphrStudio](https://www.glyphrstudio.com/app/) and added them manually.
